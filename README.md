# Optimization Repository
This repository has some algorithm code about optimization techiniques. The optimization is one important field in which we want to fit certain function to a behaviour. Or fit some paramaters in order to achieve a presition.

This repository include:

## 1. Numerical Methods

This is a guide to solve some differential equations using methods as Euler and RK4.

## 2. Optimization base of sin funcion

The principal idea is to fit some point in terms of a sine function.

## 3. Game theory saddlepoint

This code is related with the game theory in which we want to stimate the saddlepoint in a certain game base a optimization technique.
